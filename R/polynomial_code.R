#' Orthogonal Polynomial code

#' Wrapper around R's built in function

#' For n levels of factors where k in 1:n, generate a matrix with n-1 comparisons where each
#' comparison looks for a polynomial trend of degree k where each polynomial
#' is independent of the others.

#' Raw Polynomial code
#'
#' Make raw polynomial contrast, rather than orthogonal ones. Normally you
#' would use orthogonal polynomials, so make sure this is what you want. Using
#' raw polynomials may increase the collinearity in your model, especially with
#' higher levels.

#' For n levels of factors where k in 1:n, generate a matrix with n-1 comparisons where each
#' comparison looks for a polynomial trend of degree k where each polynomial
#' may be correlated with the others. Normally you would use orthogonal polynomials.
