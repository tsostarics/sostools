#' Scaled sum coding
#'
#' This is also sometimes called simple, sum, or deviation coding depending on
#' the field and source. Use this to compare each level to a reference level.
#'
#' For n levels of factors, generate a matrix with n-1 comparisons where:
#' \itemize{
#'  \item Reference level = -1/n
#'  \item Comparison level = (n-1)/n
#'  \item All others = -1/n
#'}
#'
#' Example interpretation for a 4 level factor:
#' \itemize{
#'  \item Intercept = Grand mean (mean of the means of each level)
#'  \item grp2 = mean(grp2) - mean(grp1)
#'  \item grp3 = mean(grp3) - mean(grp1)
#'  \item grp4 = mean(grp4) - mean(grp1)
#'}
#' Note: grp coefficient estimates are the same as with contr.treatment, but
#' the intercept is changed to the grand mean instead of the mean of grp1.
#'
#' IMPORTANT: This coding scheme is NOT the same as contr.sum/2 when the number
#' of levels is GREATER than 2. When k=2, estimates with contr.sum can be interpreted
#' as "half the distance between levels" but when k>2, contr.sum is to be interpreted
#' as "the distance between this level and the GRAND MEAN". You may be tempted
#' to use contr.sum(k)/2, but I'm really not sure how the estimates can even
#' be interpreted, and it's definitely not what you're looking for here.
