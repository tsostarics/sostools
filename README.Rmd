This is just a collection of functions I use in my research that I use
frequently. Other functions I use infrequently can be found in my `snippets`
repo. Since a lot of this is stuff that I use for my personal work,
it's not guaranteed to work flawlessly in other contexts.

## Installation

You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("tsostarics/sostools", build_vignettes = TRUE)
```
## Easily reference coefficients in prose

Here is a simple example of referencing the values of a model summary
without needing to hand write or format it yourself. See `?get_coef` for more
information. `make_coef_getter` is a function factory that provides a shorthand
if you have multiple models you're working with.

```{r example}
library(sostools)
library(tidyverse)
mdl <- lm(mpg ~ cyl * gear, data = mtcars) # Create model
coefs <- enlist_coefs(mdl) # Create coefficients
get_coef1 <- make_coef_getter(mdl) # Using the model object directly
get_coef2 <- make_coef_getter(coefs) # Using the list of coefficients we made
get_coef("cyl:gear", coefs)
get_coef1("cyl:gear")
get_coef2("cyl:gear")
```

Here we can get the formatted values of a write up easily with in-line R code.
You could say something like: We found no significant effect of cylinder 
`r get_coef2("cyl")` or gear `r get_coef2("gear")` nor a significant interaction
between the two `r get_coef2("cyl:gear")`.

You can also use these with Bayesian models fit with `brms`, which will give you
the $\beta$ estimate as well as the credible interval.

## Contrast coding functionality
